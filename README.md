See Live [Reddit App](https://github/chriswiles.com/)


## Linting
```js
> `npm run lint`
```


### Tech

Reddit uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) - Open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) - Google's material design UI components built with React.
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
* [Node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework
* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) - Create, deploy, and manage apps in the cloud
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
* [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js


### Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run
```

### Todos
* Utilize server side rendering for the initial render.
* Use [graphqlhub](https://www.graphqlhub.com/)
