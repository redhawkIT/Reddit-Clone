* [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise) - FSA-compliant promise middleware for Redux.
* [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) - Google's material design UI components built with React.
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)

* [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework
* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) - Create, deploy, and manage apps in the cloud
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - Takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
* [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [ESLint](eslint.org) - Lint JS. Reports syntax and style issues. Using eslint-plugin-react for additional React specific linting rules.
